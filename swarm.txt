Docker Swam:
Freely available with CE (community edition)
Features:
 - High available
 - Load Balancing
 - Resiliency
 - Placement of new load
 - Declarative service model

Setting up Swarm:
 - docker swarm init - To start a swarm for the first time.
 Most of the swarm management commands run from the master node only.
 - docker node ls (Runs only from Master/Leader)
 - DS-Master - docker swarm join-token (worker/manager) run from the master node
 - docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-4v24l56nf5uryrvona02zs4wi72l1tuseqtteb2fyrz7cks59l-98ngizzq5vn7bxubhx51anlyn 10.30.1.243:2377
 - DS-Node -
Copy and run this above output to the worker node.
 - docker info | grep -i swarm - to check the swarm status for the node.

 - docker service create --name <app1> --replicate=4 ngnix
This will create 4 containers and distribute those across the swarm nodes and will maintain HA and resilience in the event of container or node failure .
 - docker service ls - lists the services
 - docker service update --autolock true - Store this key safely for future use.

 - docker swarm unlock-key - To get the lock key incase you forgot (This is possible only if the docker/swarm has not restarted since you enabled autolock.)

 - docker swarm  unlock-key --rotate

 - docker node promote <node id> - To promote a node as master. Node ID can be retrieved from
 docker node ls
 - docker node demote <node id> - To demote a node as worker node.
 - docker node update --availability drain <node id> - Will move all the containers to other available nodes from the given node.
 no new containers will be hosted on the drained node.

Quoram:
Docker Quoram is based on Raft Concensus
(n-1)/2 - 
(n/2)+1 - (for the swarm to run)

 Stack:
 Is text file written in YAML file used to deploy a stack.
 Used to define a complete, multi-tiered, highly available, highly scalable application to a swarm cluster.
 Deploying collection of services across swarm node cluster.
